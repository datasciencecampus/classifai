    "One-hot encoding is a simple method of converting from text to vector format. Each element in a one-hot encoded vector represents the presence or absence of a particular word in a large vocabulary. Therefore the length of the vector represents the size of the vocabulary. Each word in a sentence is transformed so that the the corresponding positional elements in the one-hot encoding vector will be set to 1. So, all sentences that contain the word 'dog' should all have the same element i of their vectors set to 1, which is the element that represents the presence of the word dog. Finally, if the converted sentence only contains 5 words, then the vector will only have 5 non-zero elements at most."
