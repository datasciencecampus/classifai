    "##### ClassifAI uses Pandas dataframe-like dataclasses to specify what data need to be passed as input to the VectorStore methods/functions, and what data can be expected to be returned by those methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The **VectorStore** class, responsible for performing different actions with your data, has **three key methods/functions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`search()`**  \n",
    "    - Takes in a body of text and searches the vector store for semantically similar knowledgebase samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`reverse_search()`**  \n",
    "    - Takes in document IDs and searches the vector store for entries with those IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`embed()`**  \n",
    "    - Takes in a body of text and uses the vectoriser model to convert the text into embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these three core methods, we have created an **input dataclass** and an **output dataclass**. These dataclasses define pandas-like objects that specify what data needs to be passed to each method and also perform runtime checks to ensure you've passed the correct columns in a dataframe to the appropriate VectorStore method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the figure below illustrates the input and output dataclasses of the `VectorStore.search()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "![VectorStore Search Dataflow](./files/vectorstore_search_dataflow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that the `VectorStore.search()` method expects:\n",
    "- An **input dataclass object** with columns `[id, query]`. \n",
    "- To output an **output dataclass object** with columns `[query_id, query_text, doc_id, doc_text, rank, score]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of these dataclasses both helps the user of the package to understand what data needs to be provided to the Vectorstore and how a user should interact with the objects being returned by these VectorStore functions. Additionally, this ensures robustness of the package by checking that the correct columns are present in the data before operating on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse_search() and embed() VectorStore functions have their own input and output data classes with their own validity column data checks. The names of each set are intuitively:\n",
    "| **VectorStore Method**       | **Input Dataclass**         | **Output Dataclass**        |\n",

    "| `VectorStore.embed()`     | `VectorStoreEmbedInput`     | `VectorStoreEmbedOutput`    |\n",

    "## Hooks and custom dataflows\n",
    "\n",
    "We have implemented 'hooks' where users can write a function that will manipulate the content of a dataclasses object before or after it passes through the VectorStore. \n",
    "\n",
    "As long as your custom hook function takes as input an instance of a dataclass, and outputs a valid instance of the same type, then your custom function should run as a part of the end to end VectorStore process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: you might want to preprocess the input to the VectorStore.search() method to remove punctuation from the texts:\n",
    "\n",
    "![VectorStore Search Dataflow](./files/search_spellcheck_hook.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a later part of the demo, we showcase how to implement this punctuation removing function, and apply it to the vectorstore. The important concept here is that the hook function takes in a `VectorStoreSearchInput` object, and outputs a valid `VectorStoreSearchInput` object. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This can then be attached to a VectorStore to run every time the VectorStore search method is called. You can also apply other hooks to other dataclasses and their respective VectorStore methods and chain togtether these custom operations that manipulate the input and output dataclasses of the VectorStore methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, implmenting 2 hooks for the input and output dataclasses of the VectorStore search method would provide a dataflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "![End to end Search with 2 hooks](./files/pre_and_post_search_hooks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The above diagram shows a case where two hooks would be implemented: One that operates on the dataclass `VectorStoreSearchInput`that is passed to the Vectortore search method; and a second hook operating on the `VectorStoreSearchOutput` dataclass that is returned from the VectorStore search method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hooks can perform pretty much any operation, as long as they accept and return a valid dataclass object - we hope that this provides a lot of freedom to users to be able to transform and manipulate data as needed using ClassifAI.</b>"

    "- We wrote and combined several hooks on the Vectorstore class to:\n",
    "    - remove punctuation from queries before the  ```VectorStore.search()``` method is executed\n",
    "    - remove duplicates from the results list per query ranking and fixed the ranking\n",
    "    - injected data into our dataflow outside of constructing a vectorstore\n",
    "    - chained several Vectorstore.search() postprocessing steps together into one function that calls other functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this scenario we effectively showed how to deduplicate the rows of the results dataframe and add additional context columns of information in the form of the id_definitions. Hopefully, it is clear that you can add many pre- or post-processing steps this way, or by writing all steps in one big function - Hooks give you the flexibility and choice here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hooks let you disrupt the normal flow of data in the VectorStores. In this case we just had a small amount of dictionary data being added in, however the hooks allow for more complex scenarios:\n",
    "    - using a 3rd party API to do automated corrective spell checking before passing your queries to the search method\n",
    "    - making an SQL query call to a database to get the extra information you want to inject in each row\n",
    "    - handle errors when the API or database fails and choose what should be returned in these cases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaway:\n",
    "- When writing your custom hook, remember that your custom hook function should take a single argument - a specific dataclass, and it should output that same dataclass with the modified rows, columns and values. How you implement the logic to update the values is up to you but it must satify the requirements of that dataclass type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depending on which kind of hook you are writing, you need to adhere to the rules of the corresponding dataclass for that hook. For example, in the above demonstration we focused on writing search() preprocessing hooks that manipulate the VectorStoreSearchInput dataclass. However, if you were to write a reverse_search() preprocessing hook, your hook function would need to manipulate the VectorStore<b>Reverse</b>SearchInput dataclass, which has a different set of rules for the columns that must be present and the datatypes of those columns. This extends to each of the hook categories, each of which corresponds to a specific dataclass with its own ruleset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps and Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We focused soley on showcasing pre- and post-processing hooks for the VectorStore search method in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- See if you can implement some pre- and post- processing hooks for the VectorStore reverse search method:\n",
    "    - try adding a new column of data to the reverse search results \n",
    "    - make it so that if the user tries to reverse search for a specific ID that is 'secret' then that row is removed from the input data."
