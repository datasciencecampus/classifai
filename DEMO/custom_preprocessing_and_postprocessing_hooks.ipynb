    "### Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We wrote and combined several hooks on the Vectorstore class to:\n",
    "    - remove punctuation from queries before the  ```VectorStore.search()``` method is executed\n",
    "    - remove duplicates from the results list per query ranking and fixed the ranking\n",
    "    - injected data into our dataflow outside of constructing a vectorstore\n",
    "    - chained several Vectorstore.search() postprocessing steps together into one function that calls other functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this scenario we effectively showed how to deduplicate the rows of the results dataframe and add additional context columns of information in the form of the id_definitions. Hopefully, it is clear that you can add many pre- or post-processing steps this way, or by writing all steps in one big function - Hooks give you the flexibility and choice here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hooks let you disrupt the normal flow of data between Vectoriser, VectorStores and the RestAPI system. In this case we just had a small amount of dictionary data being added in, however the Hooks allow for more complex scenarios:\n",
    "    - using a 3rd party API to do automated corrective spell checking before passing your queries to the search method\n",
    "    - making an SQL query call to a database to get the extra information you want to inject in each row\n",
    "    - handle errors qhwn the API or database fails and just return the original Pydantic object or throw an error if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps and Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We focused soley on showcasing pre- and post-processing hooks for the VectorStore in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- See if you can implement some pre- and post- processing hooks for the Vectoriser class of you choice:\n",
    "    - try doing punctuation removal in the Vectoriser ```transform_preprocess()``` method and see how it is subtly different from performing this in the ```search_preprocess()``` hook of the VectorStore\n",
    "    - you could also try normalising the Numpy arrays returned by the vectoriser so that in the vectorstore construction and search your vectors will all be normalised and the search results will all contain values between 0 and 1."
